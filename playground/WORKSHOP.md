# web application performance

- what is performance?
  - speed
    - network
    - computation
    - responsiveness
  - memory utilization
  - application size
- when do we have a performance problem?
  - what are indicators of problems?
    - (out of memory) errors
    - noticeable delay in the UI
    - waiting for backend data
  - bad user experience
  - your app becomes unreliable
  - your app costs a lot more than expected
  - developers tend to over-"optimize"
  - set goals -> know when to stop
  - optimization is a tradeoff
    - you can't have optimal speed, memory, and size
    - you can't have optimal readability and performance
    - optimizing takes a lot of time
- how do we analyze performance?
  - measuring!
    - benchmarking
  - 80/20 rule: You get 80% of performance benefits from 20% of optimization measures
  - rank the components in order of performance impact
  - certain tasks are just hard
    - certain algorithms are hard
    - you can't change the platform

- sources of performance issues in web applications
  - network
    - bandwidth <- how much stuff can be put through at the same time
    - latency <- how fast does the stuff travel
    - we can't change the network
      - we have to work around it
  - server
    - web server becomes overloaded
    - badly managed databases
    - poor load sharing
  - client
  - computation
    - bad architecture
    - bad management of side effects
    - race conditions / bad handling of concurrency
    - bad order of operations
    - redundant code paths
    - wrong choice of algorithm
    - wrong choice of data structure
    - bad resource management
  - (responsiveness <- more of a solution)

- execution model of browser based applications
  - UI thread
  - single threaded
  - event loop
- react basics
  - render cycle
  - updates happen if
    - the props change
    - the hooks change

- Performance issues in react apps
  - redundant rendering
    - non-static callbacks
    - non-static components
    - too broad properties
    - missing keys
